# VNA-Decoder
Master thesis work creating a decoder for quantum error correction using variational neural annealing with RNNs

The thesis can be found at https://odr.chalmers.se/items/3c4632da-db75-4754-80b7-4674750e5719

This work is built upon code from https://github.com/QEC-project-2020/EWD-QEC and uses their EWD decoder as a reference decoder.
This work is also build upon code from https://github.com/VectorInstitute/VariationalNeuralAnnealing for the training process used to train the RNN.
